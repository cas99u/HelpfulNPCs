Helpful NPCs is a mod that adds four new NPCs that sell items that are usually boring to get.

NPCs:
- Miner (Sells bars and gems. Spawns after defeating the EoC.)
- Hunter (Sells monster drops/soul/essence related items and ammo. Spawns after defeating EoC.)
- Fisherman (Sells bait, normal fish, and quest fish. Spawns if there is an angler.)
- Environmentalist (Sells herbs, seeds, and critters. Spawns after defeating the Queen Bee)

NPC sprites and icon were made by the talented Lonely Star#6056 (Big thanks)
