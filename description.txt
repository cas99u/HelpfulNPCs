Helpful NPCs is a mod that adds five new NPCs that sell items that are usually boring to get.

NPCs:
- Miner: Sells bars, gems, and natural blocks; Requires a Glimmering Stone crafted from one stone block and gold coins
- Hunter: Sells monster drops/soul/essence related items and ammo; Requires a Glistening Gel crafted from one gel and gold coins
- Fisherman: Sells bait, normal fish, and quest fish; Requires a Radiant Fish crafted from one bass and gold coins
- Environmentalist: Sells herbs, seeds, and critters; Requires a Dazzling Flower crafted from one daybloom and gold coins
- Chester: Sells a random item that can normally be found as chest loot; Spawns randomly in the world; Not in the current version!
